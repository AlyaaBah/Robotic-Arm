# Robotic-Arm
Basic servo control for a 4-joint robotic arm using Arduino – ideal for prototyping and educational use.

## Abstract  
This project presents a foundational implementation for controlling a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) robotic arm using servo motors and an Arduino microcontroller. The system is designed to execute sequential joint movements with precise angular positioning, enabling basic articulation suitable for prototyping mechanical limbs or educational demonstrations.

## Objectives  
- To establish a reliable control mechanism for multiple servo motors  
- To simulate joint motion in a robotic arm using time-based sequencing  
- To provide a modular framework for future expansion, including sensor integration or remote control

## System Overview  
The robotic arm consists of four servo motors representing distinct joints: base, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Each motor is assigned a dedicated digital pin on the Arduino board and initialized with specific angles to simulate natural movement. The control logic employs delay-based timing to ensure smooth transitions and prevent power overload.

## Hardware Components  
- Arduino Uno (or compatible microcontroller)  
- Four servo motors (e.g., SG90 or MG996R)  
- External power supply (recommended for stable operation)  
- Jumper wires and optional breadboard for prototyping

## Implementation Notes  
- Servo angles are customizable based on mechanical constraints and desired range of motion  
- Delay functions are used for simplicity; however, non-blocking alternatives such as `millis()` are recommended for scalable systems  
- External power is advised to prevent voltage drops when operating multiple servos simultaneously

## Applications  
This system serves as a baseline for projects involving robotic articulation, such as:  
- Educational models for teaching kinematics and control theory  
- Prototypes for robotic manipulators or grippers  
- Integration with sensors for feedback-based motion planning

## Future Work  
Potential enhancements include:  
- Wireless control via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi modules  
- Sensor-based feedback loops for adaptive motion  
- Integration with AI algorithms for gesture recognition or autonomous behavior
